# ðŸ“Š Statistics Notes

Welcome! This repository is a personal collection of notes as I study statistics â€” especially concepts relevant to data analysis, machine learning, and business decision-making.

I created this repository to:
- Reinforce what I learn through summarization and examples
- Share helpful summaries with other learners
- Build a reference I can revisit when working on data science projects or interviews
